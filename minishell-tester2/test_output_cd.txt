Starting Minishell Tests

results for CD:
1. all passed!
2. note: bash output has name of programme, so we could output: minishell: cd: Eyooooo: No such file or directory
3. minishell problem with exiting:
    minishell: tcsetattr: Failed to restore terminal settings
    not exiting cleanly, does not restore the terminal to it's original state.
    I don't know if it's a problem that will get picked up in evaluation.
    I don't seem to have that error in my basic minishell, but not sure exacly what it is yet.
